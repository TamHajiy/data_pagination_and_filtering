#data_pagination_and_filtering


What you will find on a website? 


  To display list of students in a group of 9. 
  
  The pagination will increase in case if number of students increases. 
  
  I have created dynamic elements within DOM and manipulated in a way that page has displayed 5 pagination pages with maximum profile   of 9 students in each.
  
  Profile of the students include their picture, name, email address and joining date. 

Why this website exists?

  Code is written as a requirement for TeamTreeHouse project #2.
  
  It is a final projects that tests our knowldege on DOM. 

What I have learned and what you can find?

  You will be able to find code that corresponds to the DOM and its functions such as creating an element, adding class and attribute   to the element, adding element as a child to parent element, deleting element, listening to the events such as 'click' etc.
  
  Challange I have faced is to refactor code in a way that I avoid repetition.
  
  This is a work in progress and for now my purpose is to understand  and know how to right a working code. 
  
How can you use this project?

  Code for data pagination.
