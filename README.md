#data_pagination_and_filtering

Table of content
-----------------
 *list of student profiles created by DOM and student data stored in 'data' js
 *function that creates pagination based on a number of student data. 9 per page
 *event listener that corresponds to the click and changes its class 'active' to the event.target
 *call of two functions


What you will find on a website? 
--------------------------------

  To display list of students in a group of 9. 
  
  The pagination will increase in case if number of students increases. 
  
  Elements are created within DOM and manipulated in a way that page has displayed 5 pagination pages with maximum profile of 9         students in each.
  
  Profile of the students include their picture, name, email address and joining date. 

Purpose of this project?
------------------------

  Project is part of TeamTreeHouse unit #2 requirement.
  
  It is a final projects that tests students' knowldege on DOM. 

What I have learned and what you can find?
------------------------------------------

  You will be able to find code that corresponds to the DOM and its functions such as creating an element, adding class and attribute   to the element, adding element as a child to a parent element, deleting element, listening to the events such as 'click'.
  
  Challange I have faced is to refactor code in a way that I avoid repetition.
  
  This is a work in progress and for now my purpose is to understand  and know how to right a working code. 
  
How can you use this project?
-----------------------------

  Code for data pagination.
